# Project Setup
#### Navigate to backend/src/main/resources and copy applications.properties to create a file called application-dev.properties then fill out all required information. Then open your start configuration in IntelliJ and set the environment to dev.
#### Navigate to frontend and copy .env to .env.local and fill out required information.

## NOTE 
#### In the .env files you should never include secrets. These should only be on the backend. To create a new variable in the .env you need to name it in the format of REACT_APP_%variable name%.
